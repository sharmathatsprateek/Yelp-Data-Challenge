# Yelp-Data-Challenge
This data challenge Repository contains 7 files.

The files dataPrepration.py , modelCreation.py and recommendedUser.py are python files which contains the code for creating the data for the model and then building a model on the dataset and then finally build a recommendor system based on the model. 

Similarily the files dataPrepration1.py , modelCreation1.py and recommendedUser1.py are python files which contains the code for creating the data for the model and then building a model on the dataset and then finally build a recommendor system based on the model. 

The difference between these set of files is that the first set of files uses all the reviews given by users to build the model while the second set of files only takes into consideration a subset of reviews given by the user.

The file Final Report contains the detail discussion of the methods used for this project and also how the above two codes faired (i.e. the one with all reviews versus the one with a subset of reviews).
